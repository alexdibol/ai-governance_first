# Governance-First AI Collection (Six Books)

Governance-first · applied to financial practice and law · six books · PDFs + companion Colab notebooks

This repo is part of a six-book collection for regulated professional work (finance + law).

Core idea:
**Capability increases → Risk increases → Controls MUST increase.**

These books treat GenAI as **professional infrastructure**: useful only with verification, supervision, recordkeeping, privacy discipline, and clear human accountability.

## What this repository contains

- Book PDFs (each volume)
- Companion Google Colab notebooks (implementation of governance patterns)
- Reusable governance templates (scope, verification discipline, audit artifacts, review gates)

---

## The governance spine (shared by every book)

- **Generation vs verification**: model output is **Not verified** until a human validates it
- **Facts vs assumptions discipline**: separate facts provided, assumptions, and open questions
- **Scope control**: clear task boundaries, forbidden behaviors, and “stop-if” rules
- **Auditability**: logs + artifacts so work can be reconstructed and reviewed
- **Release gates**: behavioral evaluation + human approval before anything is used
- **Model-agnostic**: the governance stays valid even when models change
