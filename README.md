## What “Six + One” means

- **Six books on Applied AI (Governance-First)**  
  Focused on professional use of Generative AI across regulated domains.
- **One foundational book on Machine Learning (Governance-First)**  
  The technical and conceptual substrate that precedes AI.  
  It establishes governance discipline *before* autonomy, generation, or decision-making enter the stack.

Together, they form a **seven-volume, governance-first curriculum** designed to survive model change and regulatory scrutiny.

## Core principle

**Capability increases → Risk increases → Controls MUST increase.**

Across all seven volumes, AI and ML are treated as **professional infrastructure**, not tools for speed or novelty.  
Outputs are only acceptable when paired with verification, supervision, recordkeeping, privacy discipline, and explicit human accountability.

---

## What this repository contains

- PDFs for all volumes (AI + Machine Learning)
- Companion Google Colab notebooks for each book
- Reusable governance patterns:
  - scope and boundary definition
  - facts vs assumptions discipline
  - verification and review workflows
  - audit artifacts and release gates

---

## The governance spine (shared by every volume)

- **Generation ≠ verification**  
  Model output is always **Not verified** until a human validates it.
- **Facts vs assumptions discipline**  
  Facts provided, assumptions made, and open questions are explicitly separated.
- **Scope control**  
  Clear task definitions, forbidden behaviors, refusal posture, and stop-if rules.
- **Auditability by design**  
  Artifacts and logs enable reconstruction, supervision, and review.
- **Human accountability**  
  Responsibility never leaves the human professional.
- **Model-agnostic by design**  
  Governance remains valid as models and vendors change.
