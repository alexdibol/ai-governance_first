# Governance-First AI — Full Training Ladder

Governance-first · auditable · reproducible · human-accountable  
PDF volumes + executable Google Colab notebooks

This repository is part of the **Governance-First AI Training Suite** — a structured, end-to-end educational framework for building and deploying AI in regulated professional environments (finance, accounting, law, consulting, and investment banking).

The canonical entry point to the complete program is:

## Purpose of this Collection

This project treats AI and Machine Learning as **professional infrastructure**, not experimentation tools.

The goal is to teach practitioners how to design AI systems that are:

- auditable  
- reproducible  
- governable  
- reviewable  
- and legally defensible  

Capability is never separated from control.

**Core principle**

Capability ↑ → Risk ↑ → Controls MUST ↑

## The Governance Ladder

The training suite is organized as a progressive ladder:

### 1. Governed Machine Learning (Foundation)

Before generative systems are introduced, governance discipline is established at the ML level:

- scope definition  
- assumptions control  
- evaluation posture  
- artifact generation  
- human accountability  

Landing page:

https://alexdibol.github.io/ml-governance_first

This is the conceptual substrate for everything that follows.

---

### 2. Governed Generative AI in Professional Domains

Generative AI is introduced through organizational architecture:

- gates  
- manifests  
- logs  
- review workflows  
- evidence packets  

Applied across regulated domains:

- Audit & Accounting  
- Legal Practice  
- Financial Advice  
- Consulting & Corporate Strategy  
- Investment Banking  

All domain volumes are accessible here:

### 3. Fine-Tuning as Intelligence-Level Governance

Governance is extended directly into model behavior through disciplined fine-tuning:

- task scoping  
- forbidden behaviors  
- behavioral evaluation harnesses  
- approval gates  
- rollback strategies  
- monitoring  

Landing page:

https://alexdibol.github.io/ai-fine_tuning

Fine-tuning is treated as institutional control — not optimization.

---

### 4. Frontier Governance (AI 2026)

The ladder culminates in a two-volume exploration of frontier AI:

- agentic systems  
- reasoning architectures  
- multimodal risk  
- emerging deployment patterns  
- governance-native design  

Landing page:

https://alexdibol.github.io/ai-governance_2026

This layer examines how modern AI research is becoming governance-aware by necessity.

## What This Repository Contains

- PDF volumes  
- Companion Google Colab notebooks  
- Executable governance patterns  
- Synthetic datasets  
- Evaluation scaffolding  
- Audit artifact templates  

Each notebook is designed to produce inspectable outputs rather than opaque results.

Reading is paired with running.  
Running is paired with artifacts.  
Artifacts are paired with human review.

## Shared Governance Spine (Across All Volumes)

Every part of the collection follows the same operational discipline:

- **Generation ≠ Verification**  
  Model outputs are always *Not verified* until reviewed by a human.

- **Facts vs Assumptions Separation**  
  Inputs, assumptions, and open questions are explicitly tracked.

- **Scope Control**  
  Clear task definitions, refusal posture, and stop-conditions.

- **Auditability by Design**  
  Logs and artifacts enable reconstruction and supervision.

- **Human Accountability**  
  Responsibility never transfers to the model.

- **Model-Agnostic Architecture**  
  Governance survives vendor and model changes.

---

## Intended Audience

This collection is designed for:

- Master of Finance students  
- MBA students  
- Financial practitioners  
- Consultants  
- Legal professionals  
- Technical leaders implementing AI in regulated environments  

It is delivered as instructor-guided coursework with hands-on execution.

## Use of Generative AI (Transparency Statement)

Generative AI tools may have been used to assist in drafting, editing, formatting, or code scaffolding throughout this collection.

However:

- conceptual design  
- pedagogical structure  
- governance framework  
- risk taxonomy  
- artifact standards  
- integration decisions  
- and final editorial judgment  

were **human-led, human-supervised, and human-approved at all times**.

The author assumes full responsibility for the content, structure, interpretation, and conclusions presented in this work.

All materials should be treated as potentially fallible and must be independently reviewed before any real-world use.

---

## Important Disclaimers

- Educational and research use only  
- Not investment, legal, accounting, tax, or compliance advice  
- Never input confidential or proprietary data  
- All outputs require qualified human review  
- Treat all generated content as unverified unless explicitly validated

**Summary**

This is not a prompt library.

It is a governance operating system for professional AI.
