# Governance-First AI — Complete Training Ladder (ML → Governed GenAI Ops → Fine-Tuning → Frontier)

Governance-first · auditable · reproducible · human-accountable  
Built for **MBA / Master of Finance cohorts** and **financial practitioners** operating in high-accountability environments.

## What this repository is

This repository is the **entry point** to a coherent, end-to-end education suite for learning **governed AI** in regulated professional practice.

Most AI education over-teaches capability and under-teaches control. In finance, law, audit, and regulated strategy work, “useful” means **defensible**:
reviewable, reproducible, scoped, and accountable.

This suite is designed to remain valid across model generations:

- vendors change  
- model families change  
- UI patterns change  
- **governance discipline endures**

**Core premise:**  
**Capability ↑ ⇒ Risk ↑ ⇒ Controls ↑**

---

## The governance maturity ladder (4 stages)

The training suite is intentionally sequenced. Each stage has a different “governance object,” and each stage exists because the prior one has failure modes
that must be structurally controlled.

1) **Stage 1 — Governed Machine Learning (Entry Point)**  
   Governance of datasets + models: provenance, leakage discipline, drift awareness, and evidence-first evaluation.  
   Landing page: https://alexdibol.github.io/ml-governance_first

2) **Stage 2 — Governed Generative AI (Organizational Architecture)**  
   Governance of workflows: gates, logs, manifests, review packets, refusal posture, traceability.  
   Landing page: https://alexdibol.github.io/ai-governed_generative_applications/

3) **Stage 3 — Fine-Tuning (Governance of Intelligence)**  
   Governance inside the system: task boundaries, behavioral evaluation harnesses, approval gates, monitoring, rollback, and accountability.  
   Landing page: https://alexdibol.github.io/ai-fine_tuning/

4) **Stage 4 — Frontier Governance (Governance-Native Systems)**  
   Frontier systems treated as governance-native: tool mediation, provenance, long-context controls, multimodal defenses, evaluation harnesses, control stacks.  
   Landing page: https://alexdibol.github.io/ai-governance_2026/

**Navigation rule:** Always route newcomers through **Stage 1**. Do not start at Stage 4.

## What this repository contains

This repository functions as a **collection map + governance spine** across the ladder:

- links to stage landing pages and domain volumes
- reusable governance patterns (scope, boundaries, review posture)
- shared expectations for notebooks and artifact bundles
- contribution and conduct standards for public collaboration

> Note: Individual books and notebooks live in their respective repositories.  
> This repository is the governed index and the stable entry point.

## Shared governance spine (applies across the entire ladder)

Every stage and every domain volume enforces a common posture:

- **Generation ≠ verification**  
  Model output is always **Not verified** until a qualified human validates it.

- **Facts vs assumptions discipline**  
  Facts provided, assumptions made, and open questions are explicitly separated.

- **Scope and boundary control**  
  Clear task definitions, forbidden behaviors, refusal posture, and stop-if rules.

- **Auditability by design**  
  Artifacts and logs enable reconstruction, supervision, and review.

- **Human accountability**  
  Responsibility never leaves the human professional.

- **Model-agnostic by design**  
  Governance remains valid as models and vendors change.

## Who this is for

Designed for:

- MBA and Master of Finance students  
- financial practitioners in regulated environments  
- risk / compliance / model governance teams  
- transformation and innovation leaders  
- instructors teaching applied AI responsibly  

This is not a “prompt tricks” repository.

The objective is not performance.  
The objective is **governance literacy** and **professional defensibility**.

## Use of generative AI tools (transparency statement)

Generative AI tools may have been used to assist in drafting, editing, formatting, or code scaffolding across the broader collection.

However:

- conceptual design  
- pedagogical structure  
- governance logic and control definitions  
- integration decisions  
- final editorial judgment and acceptance  

were **human-led, human-supervised, and human-approved** at all times.

The author assumes **full responsibility** for the content, structure, interpretation, and conclusions presented in this work.

## IMPORTANT DISCLAIMERS (read before use)

### Educational / Non-Reliance
All materials are provided **for educational and research purposes only**.  
Nothing in this repository (or linked repositories) constitutes:

- investment advice  
- trading advice  
- legal advice  
- tax advice  
- accounting or audit advice  
- compliance determinations  
- operational recommendations  

Qualified human professionals must review, verify, and approve any real-world use.

### Not verified
Unless explicitly stated otherwise in a particular artifact, treat all outputs, claims, calculations, citations, and conclusions as **Not verified**.

### Confidentiality and data hygiene
Do not paste confidential, proprietary, regulated, or personally identifying information into external systems.  
Use anonymization/redaction and **minimum-necessary** inputs by default.  
You are responsible for compliance with privacy, confidentiality, recordkeeping, and information security obligations.

### No fabricated sources or claims
Zero tolerance for invented citations, product terms, performance claims, fees, or consequences.  
When evidence is missing, the correct output is a **verification task list**, not persuasive narrative.
